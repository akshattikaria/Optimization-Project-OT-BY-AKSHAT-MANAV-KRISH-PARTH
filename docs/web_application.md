# Web application: Clockwork frontend on the final optimizer

The website (`frontend/`, React + Vite + TypeScript) and its application layer (`api/campus/`: accounts, calendar,
leave, substitutes, quizzes, assessments, holidays, syllabus, requests, notifications) come from the Clockwork
project. The optimization side is this repository's final method, unchanged: `src/timetable/` is not modified
by the website, and no other optimizer is used.

## Running it

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt        # numpy, matplotlib, pytest, fastapi, uvicorn, httpx
npm --prefix frontend ci
python -m uvicorn api.server:app --port 8000     # terminal 1, from the project root
npm --prefix frontend run dev                    # terminal 2
```

Open <http://localhost:5173> and sign in as `admin` / `admin` (change the password at once). Data is kept in
`data/clockwork.db` (delete it to start over). Without the Python server the website shows built-in **offline demo
data**, clearly labelled, which is not optimizer output.

* **Instances.** `demo` is Clockwork's two-division department expressed in the optimizer's model; `small`,
  `medium` and `large` are the report's generator presets (instance seed selectable); `published` re-optimises the
  instance of the published timetable; **Upload JSON** accepts either the website format or the CLI format
  (for example `data/benchmark/medium_10.json`).
* **Teacher constraints.** Blocked periods and a maximum per day saved under *My teaching* or *Manage → Availability*
  are merged into the instance before the run (`api/bridge.py: apply_constraints`) and are therefore hard
  constraints of the search, of the independent check and of later substitutions.
* **Optimizer.** `memetic_nsga2` is called with the validation study's defaults (population 24; budget/time per size
  from `experiments/enhancement_validation.json`). Its only hook used is the `evaluator` argument, wrapped to count
  calls for the progress bar; it still calls the shared `evaluate`.
* **Baseline in the website.** The repeated greedy/DSatur baseline gets exactly the number of full evaluations the
  memetic run used and the same seed (equal-evaluation protocol). The Overview shows both hypervolumes; the Pareto
  page overlays the greedy front and tabulates both. A single website run is an illustration; the evidence remains
  the paired multi-seed study in the report.
* **Advanced benchmark (optional).** A normal "Run optimiser" executes only the final memetic method and the greedy
  baseline. Ticking *Advanced benchmark* under the advanced run options (`advancedBenchmark: true` in
  `POST /api/runs`) additionally runs MOEA/D, AMOSA and standard NSGA-II with the same evaluations and seed. It is
  off by default because it makes every run several times longer and never changes the timetables offered, which
  always come from the memetic method.
* **Measured values only.** The convergence chart and the comparison table show what the last run measured. An
  algorithm that was not run is listed as "Not run" with no curve, points or numbers; one that ran without finding a
  feasible timetable, or that raised an error, is reported as exactly that.
* **Provenance.** Each run is saved in the CLI's own format under `results/web/<run id>/` (`instance.json`,
  `run.json`, `baseline.json`, `compromise_schedule.json`), so it can be re-validated with
  `python main.py evaluate results/web/<run id>/instance.json results/web/<run id>/compromise_schedule.json`.
  The last ten runs are also kept in the database (`GET /api/runs/latest`).
* **Representatives.** *Fewest gaps*, *Least room wastage*, *Most balanced* and *Best compromise* are the same four
  selections as `export_representatives` (the compromise is the report's `normalized_compromise`).

## Disruptions (minimal-change re-optimisation)

`api/disruptions.py` watches the published timetable: clashing teacher availability, long leave and admin reports
open a *disruption*. The admin is alerted and can re-optimise with `timetable.disruption` (minimal repair +
ε-constraint NSGA-II), preview each option's changes and publish one. See [disruption.md](disruption.md#on-the-website).

## Website ↔ optimizer format

`api/bridge.py` converts both ways without loss (checked by `tests/test_web_bridge.py`). A slot index is
`day × len(periods) + period` with lunch counted in `periods`, which is exactly the optimizer's flat time index, so
availability needs no re-indexing. Names (teacher, room, subject, period labels) are kept in the problem's
`metadata.labels`; event ids of website instances are kept too, so calendar records stay valid.

## Tests

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_web_bridge.py tests/test_web_campus.py
```

End-to-end check against running servers (use a fresh database; it publishes a timetable and creates accounts,
leave, quizzes, holidays...):

```bash
python experiments/web_integration_check.py --api http://127.0.0.1:8000 --web http://localhost:5173
```

Results of the final check are in [final_integration_check.md](final_integration_check.md).

They cover the exact round trip of instances and timetables, the role rules and calendar flows ported from
Clockwork, a real optimizer run started through the API (teacher availability respected, equal-evaluation
baseline, run kept server-side) and the refusal to publish an infeasible timetable.
