 notes='Full references and exact roles are in literature/README.md. Every member should explain why teacher choice changes workload, why labs reserve all periods, constraint domination among infeasible candidates, why equal evaluation counts are not equal computation, what makes the final algorithm an NSGA-II variant, the scopes of exact guarantees, and why workload balance can hurt students. The mandatory front-cleanup command is python experiments/exact_fronts.py --study enhancement_validation. It leaves frozen search/timing records unchanged and writes exact rational reporting fronts separately. The presentation builder reads saved artifacts only and runs no optimizer. The source hash of measured validation is '+manifest['source_sha256']+'.',source='literature/README.md; docs/reference_review.md; manifest.json')
